# blink-led
ESP32 starting project

Simple project to blink the LED situated at pin 12 on the ESP32 board. With a function that countes how many times the board has had a restart and a posibility to reset this counter (example: restart counter will reset after 10 restarts), along with a BUZZ located at pin 13 signaling with one short buzz when restart counter was reset to 0 and one longer buzz when the restart counter is equal to 3.
